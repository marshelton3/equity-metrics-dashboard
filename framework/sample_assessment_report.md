# OPERATIONAL EQUITY FRAMEWORK
## Comprehensive Assessment Report

**Organization:** Sample Health System  
**Assessment Date:** November 12, 2025  
**Prepared By:** Marshawn Shelton, MPH, PMP, CCMP  
**Organization:** Isosalus

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Sample Health System completed the Operational Equity Framework assessment, evaluating operational infrastructure across Process, People, and Technology pillars. The assessment reveals **critical gaps** across all three dimensions, with an overall score of **31.7%**.

### Key Findings:
- **TECHNOLOGY (21%):** Most significant gaps - Unable to stratify outcomes by race/ethnicity in real-time, no automated risk alerts, limited portal accessibility
- **PEOPLE (34%):** Critical workforce gaps - No equity metrics tied to performance, insufficient language capacity, no Chief Equity Officer
- **PROCESS (40%):** Foundational workflows lacking - No evening/weekend appointments, transportation barriers unaddressed, limited care coordination

### Bottom Line:
Despite likely having equity policies and coverage expansions, Sample Health System lacks the operational infrastructure to translate policy into equitable outcomes. Based on maternal mortality research (2018-2024), organizations with this profile see minimal improvement from policy changes alone—typically <10% outcome improvement even with expanded coverage.

**Immediate Action Required:** Technology infrastructure represents the most critical gap and should be addressed first to enable measurement, accountability, and improvement.

- ✓ SDOH screening process in place
- ✓ Care coordination across some settings
- ✓ ED protocols for maternal emergencies

#### Critical Gaps:
1. **Access Barriers (0/5 points)**
   - No evening/weekend appointment options
   - Transportation assessed but not addressed
   - Only 2 appointment modalities available
   - *Impact:* Working mothers and rural patients cannot access care despite coverage

2. **Language & Cultural Accessibility (2/5 points)**
   - Only 26-50% of pathways have language accommodations
   - Interpreters not embedded in workflows (on-request only)
   - *Impact:* Non-English speakers face navigation barriers

3. **Care Coordination (2/5 points)**
   - Manual referral coordination creates delays
   - High-risk patients identified but no enhanced pathways
   - No doula integration
   - *Impact:* Vulnerable patients fall through gaps

4. **Proactive Outreach (0/5 points)**
   - Postpartum follow-up recommended but not enforced
   - No missed appointment outreach
   - *Impact:* Preventable complications become crises

#### Recommended Actions:
1. Implement evening/weekend clinic hours within 90 days
2. Partner with transportation services (Lyft Health, local transit)
3. Embed professional interpreters in all clinical workflows
4. Create enhanced care pathways for high-risk patients
5. Establish doula program with Medicaid billing integration

- ✓ 51-75% of new hires receive equity onboarding

#### Critical Gaps:
1. **Accountability Vacuum (0/5 points)**
   - No equity metrics in performance evaluations
   - No Chief Equity Officer position
   - Only 26-50% of leadership have equity in job descriptions
   - *Impact:* Equity work is aspirational, not operational

2. **Skills Gap (0/5 points)**
   - Training focuses on awareness, not actionable skills

3. **Digital Divide (0/5 points)**
   - Portal only in 1-2 languages
   - Only 26-50% patient enrollment
   - Online scheduling not multilingual
   - Telehealth not ADA compliant
   - *Impact:* Technology excludes vulnerable populations

4. **Algorithm Bias (0/5 points)**
   - No equity governance for algorithms
   - 0-25% of clinical decision tools tested for equity impact
   - No IT procurement equity assessments
   - *Impact:* Technology may perpetuate or amplify disparities

5. **Data Silos (2/5 points)**
   - Only partial care integration across settings
   - SDOH data collected inconsistently
   - Ad hoc community data sharing
   - *Impact:* Cannot see full picture of patient needs

#### Recommended Actions:
1. **URGENT:** Enable real-time race/ethnicity stratification in EHR (Epic/Cerner have this capability)
2. Implement automated maternal risk alerts (hypertension, preeclampsia, postpartum depression)
3. Deploy multilingual patient portal (minimum: Spanish, plus top 3 languages in community)
4. Establish monthly equity dashboard for C-suite and board
5. Create algorithm equity governance committee before deploying predictive tools

## COMPARATIVE CONTEXT

### Where You Stand:

**Sample Health System (31.7%) vs National Benchmarks:**

| Category | Your Score | Poor Performers | Average | Best-in-Class |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| Overall | 31.7% | 0-40% | 50-60% | 80-100% |
| Process | 40% | 0-40% | 55% | 85% |
| People | 34% | 0-40% | 50% | 80% |
| Technology | 21% | 0-40% | 45% | 90% |

**Your Position:** Below average across all pillars, with Technology representing the most critical gap.

### What Research Shows:

Analysis of 2018-2024 maternal mortality data revealed:
- **Organizations with scores <40%:** Policy changes (like Medicaid extensions) yield <10% outcome improvement
- **Organizations with scores 40-60%:** Modest improvement (10-20%)
- **Organizations with scores >60%:** Significant improvement (30-50%+)

**Your Infrastructure:** Current score suggests policy alone will be insufficient to close equity gaps.

## CONCLUSION

Sample Health System demonstrates commitment to equity through policy adoption and training efforts. However, **operational infrastructure does not yet match the ambition**. Current gaps place the organization at high risk of poor equity outcomes despite policy coverage.

The good news: **These gaps are addressable**. Organizations that invest systematically in Process, People, and Technology see measurable improvement within 6-12 months.

**The framework is clear. The evidence is strong. The path forward is defined.**

**It's time to operationalize equity.**
