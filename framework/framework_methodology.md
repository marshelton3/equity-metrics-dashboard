# The Operational Equity Framework
**Version 1.0** | **Author:** Marshawn Shelton, MPH, PMP, CCMP | **Date:** November 2025

## Executive Summary

The Operational Equity Framework provides a structured approach to assessing and improving health equity through operational infrastructure. Based on analysis of maternal deaths (2018-2022), the framework demonstrates that policy coverage alone is insufficient. Organizations must invest equally in Process, People, and Technology.

## The Three Pillars

### PILLAR 1: PROCESS
**Definition:** Care workflows, service delivery pathways, and operational procedures that either facilitate or impede equitable access and outcomes.

**Key Components:**
- Care pathway design and documentation
- Language and cultural accessibility
- Transportation and access solutions
- Workflow integration and coordination
- Referral systems and care transitions
- Scheduling and appointment systems

**Why It Matters:**
Policy says "coverage is available." Process determines if people can actually ACCESS that coverage. During COVID-19, telehealth coverage expanded universally. But communities without internet access, digital literacy, or language-appropriate platforms couldn't use it. The PROCESS failed.

**Maternal Health Example:**
- Policy: Medicaid covers prenatal care
- Process failure: No evening/weekend appointments for working mothers
- Result: Late or no prenatal care despite having coverage

---

### PILLAR 2: PEOPLE
**Definition:** Workforce capability, training, cultural competence, and accountability structures that enable equitable service delivery.

**Key Components:**
- Staff training and development
- Cultural competency and humility
- Language capacity (bilingual staff, interpreters)
- Accountability metrics tied to equity outcomes
- Leadership commitment and resources
- Community health workers and peer support

**Why It Matters:**
Coverage creates eligibility. People determine quality and appropriateness of care. Analysis showed that communities of color experienced worse COVID-19 maternal mortality increases despite universal policy responses because workforce capacity (trained interpreters, doulas, culturally competent providers) was lacking.

**Maternal Health Example:**
- Policy: All pregnant patients get prenatal care
- People failure: No Spanish-speaking providers, no doula support
- Result: Hispanic mothers don't engage with care despite access

---

### PILLAR 3: TECHNOLOGY
**Definition:** Data infrastructure, monitoring systems, and technology tools that enable measurement, accountability, and improvement.

**Key Components:**
- EHR systems capable of stratification by race/ethnicity
- Real-time outcome monitoring and alerts
- Data integration across care settings
- Patient-facing technology (portals, apps, telehealth)
- Analytics and reporting capability
- Quality improvement infrastructure

**Why It Matters:**
"What gets measured gets managed." Without technology to track outcomes by demographic group in real-time, organizations cannot identify disparities, intervene early, or measure improvement. Analysis revealed that disparity gaps widened during COVID—but many systems couldn't even track this in real-time to respond.

**Maternal Health Example:**
- Policy: Monitor maternal outcomes
- Technology failure: Can't stratify by race in EHR, delayed reporting
- Result: Don't know Black mothers dying at higher rates until months later

## Framework Validation: Evidence from Maternal Mortality

#### The Natural Experiment: Evidence from 2018-2022 Data

**Analysis Period:** 2018-2022 (6,214 maternal deaths, 19.3 million births)

**Baseline Period (2018-2019):** Pre-COVID disparities established
- AIAN mothers: 31.1 per 100K (2.4x White rate)
- Black mothers: 30.1 per 100K (2.3x White rate)
- Hispanic mothers: 9.0 per 100K (0.7x White rate - protective factor)
- White mothers: 13.0 per 100K (baseline)

**COVID-19 Stress Test (2020-2021):** Universal policy expansion implemented
- Emergency Medicaid coverage expanded ✓
- Telehealth reimbursement implemented ✓
- Hospital surge capacity policies ✓
- Testing access universalized ✓

**Critical Finding:** Despite universal policy expansion, disparities WIDENED dramatically

**Peak Crisis (2021):**
- AIAN mothers: 91.1 per 100K (4.4x White rate) — **+192% increase from 2018**
- Black mothers: 69.9 per 100K (2.8x White rate) — **+86% increase from 2018**
- Hispanic mothers: 18.2 per 100K (1.1x White rate) — **+141% increase, flipped from protective to high-risk**
- White mothers: 25.4 per 100K (baseline increase: +30%)

**Partial Recovery (2022):**
- Total deaths declined from 2021 peak
- BUT remained 30-80% above 2018 baseline
- Disparities persisted despite policy continuation

**Policy Intervention Begins (April 2022):**
- Medicaid postpartum extension (60 days → 12 months)
- States implementing throughout 2022-2024
- Coverage now established, implementation ongoing

### Framework Validation: What We Learned from 2018-2022

**Key Insight:** Policy coverage alone is insufficient. Organizations lacking operational infrastructure saw minimal improvement despite universal policy expansion.

**The COVID-19 natural experiment revealed:**

1. **Coverage ≠ Access** (Process failure)
   - Telehealth covered, but communities lacked internet, devices, digital literacy
   - Evening/weekend appointments not offered despite need
   - Transportation barriers unaddressed
   - Language-appropriate care unavailable

2. **Policy ≠ Capability** (People failure)
   - Providers lacked cultural competency training
   - Insufficient bilingual staff
   - No accountability metrics for equity outcomes
   - Workforce not representative of communities served

3. **Expansion ≠ Monitoring** (Technology failure)
   - Systems couldn't stratify outcomes by race in real-time
   - Disparities identified months too late to intervene
   - No automated alerts for high-risk conditions
   - Data silos prevented care coordination

### Framework Hypothesis (To Be Tested with Future Data)

Organizations with strong operational infrastructure across all three pillars will achieve better equity outcomes from policy changes than organizations with policy coverage alone.

**Predicted Pattern (Testable when 2023-2024 data available):**
- **High infrastructure organizations (framework score >60%):** 30-50% improvement from Medicaid extension
- **Moderate infrastructure (score 40-60%):** 10-20% improvement
- **Low infrastructure (score <40%):** <10% improvement or continued worsening

**Testing in Project 5:** State-level analysis will validate whether infrastructure predicts policy effectiveness.

## Assessment Methodology

### Scoring Approach

Organizations complete a 60-question assessment (20 per pillar) evaluating operational infrastructure across Process, People, and Technology dimensions.

**Question Types:**
- Binary (Yes/No): 3 points yes, 0 points no
- Scale (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100%): 0, 1, 2, 3 points
- Multiple choice: Weighted by sophistication level

**Scoring:**
- Each pillar: 0-100 points (20 questions × 5 points max each = 100)
- Overall score: Average of three pillars (0-100)

**Interpretation:**
- 0-40: Critical gaps (high risk of poor outcomes)
- 41-60: Moderate gaps (some infrastructure present)
- 61-80: Minor gaps (strong baseline, improvement areas identified)
- 81-100: Best-in-class (comprehensive infrastructure)
