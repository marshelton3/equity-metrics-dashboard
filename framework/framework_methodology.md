# The Operational Equity Framework
**Version 1.0** | **Author:** Marshawn Shelton, MPH, PMP, CCMP | **Date:** November 2025

## Executive Summary

The Operational Equity Framework provides a structured approach to assessing and improving health equity through operational infrastructure. Based on analysis of maternal deaths (2018-2024), the framework demonstrates that policy coverage alone is insufficient. Organizations must invest equally in Process, People, and Technology.

## The Three Pillars

### PILLAR 1: PROCESS
**Definition:** Care workflows, service delivery pathways, and operational procedures that either facilitate or impede equitable access and outcomes.

**Key Components:**
- Care pathway design and documentation
- Language and cultural accessibility
- Transportation and access solutions
- Workflow integration and coordination
- Referral systems and care transitions
- Scheduling and appointment systems

**Why It Matters:**
Policy says "coverage is available." Process determines if people can actually ACCESS that coverage. During COVID-19, telehealth coverage expanded universally. But communities without internet access, digital literacy, or language-appropriate platforms couldn't use it. The PROCESS failed.

**Maternal Health Example:**
- Policy: Medicaid covers prenatal care
- Process failure: No evening/weekend appointments for working mothers
- Result: Late or no prenatal care despite having coverage

---

### PILLAR 2: PEOPLE
**Definition:** Workforce capability, training, cultural competence, and accountability structures that enable equitable service delivery.

**Key Components:**
- Staff training and development
- Cultural competency and humility
- Language capacity (bilingual staff, interpreters)
- Accountability metrics tied to equity outcomes
- Leadership commitment and resources
- Community health workers and peer support

**Why It Matters:**
Coverage creates eligibility. People determine quality and appropriateness of care. Analysis showed that communities of color experienced worse COVID-19 maternal mortality increases despite universal policy responses because workforce capacity (trained interpreters, doulas, culturally competent providers) was lacking.

**Maternal Health Example:**
- Policy: All pregnant patients get prenatal care
- People failure: No Spanish-speaking providers, no doula support
- Result: Hispanic mothers don't engage with care despite access

---

### PILLAR 3: TECHNOLOGY
**Definition:** Data infrastructure, monitoring systems, and technology tools that enable measurement, accountability, and improvement.

**Key Components:**
- EHR systems capable of stratification by race/ethnicity
- Real-time outcome monitoring and alerts
- Data integration across care settings
- Patient-facing technology (portals, apps, telehealth)
- Analytics and reporting capability
- Quality improvement infrastructure

**Why It Matters:**
"What gets measured gets managed." Without technology to track outcomes by demographic group in real-time, organizations cannot identify disparities, intervene early, or measure improvement. Analysis revealed that disparity gaps widened during COVID—but many systems couldn't even track this in real-time to respond.

**Maternal Health Example:**
- Policy: Monitor maternal outcomes
- Technology failure: Can't stratify by race in EHR, delayed reporting
- Result: Don't know Black mothers dying at higher rates until months later

## Framework Validation: Evidence from Maternal Mortality

### The Natural Experiment (2018-2024)

**Baseline (2018-2019):** Established maternal mortality disparities
- AIAN: 2.4x White rate
- Black: 2.3x White rate  
- Hispanic: 0.7x White rate (protective)

**COVID-19 Stress Test (2020-2021):** Universal policy expansion
- Emergency Medicaid coverage ✓
- Telehealth reimbursement ✓
- Hospital surge capacity ✓

**Result:** Disparities WIDENED
- AIAN: 4.4x White rate (+192% increase)
- Black: 2.8x White rate (+86% increase)
- Hispanic: 1.1x White rate (flipped to high-risk, +141% increase)

**Policy Intervention (April 2022):** Medicaid postpartum extension
- Extended coverage from 60 days to 12 months postpartum
- All states implementing 2022-2024

**Outcome (2023-2024):** [Analysis in progress]
- Did coverage alone reduce disparities?
- Or did infrastructure matter more?

### Framework Hypothesis

Organizations with strong operational infrastructure (all three pillars) will show better outcomes than organizations with policy coverage alone.

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- **High infrastructure states:** 30-50% improvement post-policy
- **Policy-only states:** 10-20% improvement post-policy
- **Low infrastructure states:** <10% improvement or worsening

**Testing in Project 5:** State-level analysis will validate whether infrastructure predicts policy effectiveness.

## Assessment Methodology

### Scoring Approach

Organizations complete a 60-question assessment (20 per pillar) evaluating operational infrastructure across Process, People, and Technology dimensions.

**Question Types:**
- Binary (Yes/No): 3 points yes, 0 points no
- Scale (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100%): 0, 1, 2, 3 points
- Multiple choice: Weighted by sophistication level

**Scoring:**
- Each pillar: 0-100 points (20 questions × 5 points max each = 100)
- Overall score: Average of three pillars (0-100)

**Interpretation:**
- 0-40: Critical gaps (high risk of poor outcomes)
- 41-60: Moderate gaps (some infrastructure present)
- 61-80: Minor gaps (strong baseline, improvement areas identified)
- 81-100: Best-in-class (comprehensive infrastructure)
