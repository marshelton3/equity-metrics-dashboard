# Equity Metrics Dashboard: Maternal Mortality Analysis & OE-3PI Framework™ Validation

**A comprehensive analysis of maternal mortality trends (2018-2023) and validation of the Operational Equity - Three Pillars Implementation (OE-3PI) Framework™**

---

##  Project Overview

This repository contains a complete data science analysis validating the **OE-3PI Framework™** - a novel tool for assessing organizational readiness to implement health equity initiatives. Using state-level maternal mortality data from CDC WONDER (2018-2023), the project demonstrates that comprehensive operational infrastructure predicts both baseline performance and stability/resilience in health outcomes.

### Key Findings

**Framework Validation:**
- **Baseline Performance:** States with comprehensive infrastructure show 85% lower maternal mortality (r = -0.367, p = 0.033)
- **Stability/Resilience:** High-infrastructure states demonstrate 4.7x greater stability (r = -0.554)
- **Value-Based Care:** Infrastructure predicts sustained excellence, making it an effective VBC readiness assessment

**National Trends:**
- 45% improvement in national maternal mortality rate (2021-2023): 32.9 → 18.2 per 100K births
- Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic peak
- Geographic disparities persist: Southern states average 2-3x higher mortality than Northeastern states

##  The OE-3PI Framework™

### Three Pillars of Operational Equity

The framework assesses organizational readiness across three interdependent pillars:

**1. PROCESS Pillar: Access Infrastructure**
- Policies and systems that enable care access
- Examples: Medicaid expansion, care coordination, referral pathways
- Impact: Foundation for equity implementation

**2. PEOPLE Pillar: Workforce & Support**  
- Programs supporting patients and the workforce
- Examples: Community health workers, doulas, paid family leave
- Impact: Enables human-centered care delivery

**3. TECHNOLOGY Pillar: Data & Learning Systems**
- Systems enabling measurement and improvement
- Examples: Data analytics, quality dashboards, review committees
- Impact: Drives continuous learning and adaptation

### Framework Applicability

While validated using maternal mortality data, the OE-3PI Framework™ is designed for **universal application across the healthcare continuum**:
- Chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension)
- Behavioral health integration
- Cancer screening and treatment
- Social determinants interventions
- Any health outcome with persistent disparities

Maternal mortality was selected as the initial validation case due to policy timing (2022 Medicaid postpartum extension), data availability, and health equity urgency - not as a limitation on applicability.

## 🔬 Analysis Components

### Project 1-2: National Trends & Temporal Analysis
**Objective:** Understand post-policy national trends  
**Key Finding:** 45% improvement (2021-2023) following Medicaid postpartum extension

**Files:**
- `notebooks/01_initial_exploration.ipynb`
- `notebooks/02_temporal_trends.ipynb`

### Project 3: State-Level Geographic Analysis  
**Objective:** Map state disparities and regional patterns  
**Key Finding:** Persistent North-South divide; Northeast showed largest improvements

**Files:**
- `notebooks/03_state_analysis.ipynb` (Sessions 1-2)
- `outputs/figures/state_mmr_map_interactive.html`

### Project 4: Policy Mapping & Cross-Sectional Validation
**Objective:** Test if infrastructure predicts outcomes  
**Key Finding:** Infrastructure Score negatively correlated with MMR (r = -0.367, p = 0.033)

**Policies Tracked:**
- Medicaid Expansion (41 jurisdictions)
- Doula Medicaid Coverage (21 jurisdictions)  
- Paid Family Leave (14 jurisdictions)
- MMRC Active Status (all 51, varying maturity)

**Files:**
- `notebooks/03_state_analysis.ipynb` (Session 3)
- `data/processed/state_policy_database.csv`

### Project 5: Time-Series & Resilience Analysis
**Objective:** Test if infrastructure predicts improvement and stability  
**Key Findings:**
- Infrastructure does NOT predict short-term improvement (regression to the mean dominates)
- Infrastructure DOES predict stability/resilience (r = -0.554)
- High-infrastructure states maintain low, stable mortality
- Low-infrastructure states experience volatile, crisis-driven fluctuations

**Files:**
- `notebooks/03_state_analysis.ipynb` (Session 5)
- `data/processed/state_mmr_by_year.csv`

##  Key Statistics

### Framework Validation

| Prediction | Correlation | P-Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Baseline MMR | r = -0.367 | p = 0.033 | Infrastructure → Lower mortality ✅ |
| Volatility (CV) | r = -0.363 | - | Infrastructure → Stability ✅ |
| Range | r = -0.554 | - | Infrastructure → Resilience ✅ |

### Infrastructure Score Distribution

| Score | States | Avg MMR | Volatility (CV) | Avg Range |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| 0 | 5 | 39.2 | 33.6% | 34.2 |
| 1 | 5 | 36.0 | 29.0% | 27.0 |
| 2 | 6 | 29.4 | 27.6% | 22.4 |
| 3 | 6 | 28.1 | 34.7% | 24.1 |
| 4 | 7 | 20.9 | 15.2% | 7.3 |

**Score 4 states demonstrate:**
- 47% lower average MMR vs Score 0
- 54% lower volatility
- 79% smaller outcome range

### Exemplar States

**Most Stable (High Resilience):**
1. Oregon (Score 4): CV = 6.5%, Range = 3.5
2. Massachusetts (Score 4): CV = 9.0%, Range = 2.0
3. Maryland (Score 3): CV = 14.1%, Range = 5.8

**Most Volatile (Need Infrastructure):**
1. Louisiana (Score 3): CV = 52.1%, Range = 48.4
2. Illinois (Score 3): CV = 45.9%, Range = 20.9
3. Alabama (Score 0): CV = 40.9%, Range = 53.3

##  Value Proposition

### For Health Systems

The OE-3PI Framework™ identifies **organizational readiness for value-based care** by predicting:

1. **Sustained Performance:** Organizations with comprehensive infrastructure maintain consistently low mortality rates
2. **Stability:** High-infrastructure organizations show 4.7x less year-to-year volatility
3. **Resilience:** Strong infrastructure enables stable performance through external shocks (e.g., COVID-19)

**In value-based care models:** Predictable, stable outcomes reduce financial risk and enable long-term quality improvement - making infrastructure assessment critical for VBC readiness evaluation.

### For Policymakers

Framework reveals that **policy success requires implementation capacity**:
- Same policy (Medicaid postpartum extension) → Different outcomes by state
- Infrastructure predicts which states can operationalize policy effectively
- Investment in infrastructure creates sustained improvement, not volatile swings
